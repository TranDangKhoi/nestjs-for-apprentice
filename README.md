## NestJS overview
So apparently, this NestJS thing is built on top of Express (by default) or you can switch it to Fastify if you prefer, each of them has different performance characteristics and different patterns that you should follow.

It's a combination of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming) and also FRP (Functional Reactive Programming, as I've heard), it's a bit of a hybrid.

### Performance
Because this thing is built on top of Express, so it's not as fast as Fastify or Express (duh, because it's Express with extra features). That said, it’s still fast enough for the majority of applications.

### Is it hard to learn
Yes, it's pretty hard if you've just shifted from Express to this. There're a lot of new concepts to take in, but just embrace it and you'll find it's totally worth the effort.

On the other hand, if you're already familiar with Angular or Spring + a solid grasp of NodeJS, then it's going to be a breeze.

Oh yeah and one crystal-clear thing that I need to mention that this framework is meant for large scale apps.
